# Clubhouse
> Project from [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I learn to become full-stack developer.

In this project Iâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where my members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Purpose of the application
I'll be mastering authentication skills showing author full name to only members who has logged in. App will use MongoDB for storing users credentials as well as messages.

## Stack I'll be using 
- Node.js
- express
- mongoDB
- pug
- bootstrap

## TODO
- [x] Make models for User and Messages
- [ ] Create controllers for every expected GET and POST http request
- [ ] Create routes for all urls on site
- [ ] Create views for all routes
- [ ] Hash passwords when user sign up and login in
- [ ] Display correct view whenever user is logged in or isn't
