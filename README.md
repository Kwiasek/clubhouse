# Clubhouse
In this project Iâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where my members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Purpose of the application
I'll be mastering authentication skills showing author full name to only members who has logged in. App will use MongoDB for storing users credentials as well as messages.

## Stack I'll be using 
- Node.js
- express
- mongoDB
- pug
- bootstrap
